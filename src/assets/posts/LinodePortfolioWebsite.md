# Linode Portfolio Website
One of my projects was building this website. 
I wanted it be simple and easy to maintain. 

Thats why most of these pages are written as a **markdown file**. 

## How did you get the domain
The domain is purchased via GoDaddy.com.

## Why linode?
Linode is very easy to use. 
I also love that the Linux operating system.

### Configuration of the Linode
#### SSH 
SSH with public private key.

#### Firewall
UFW

#### Java

#### Nginx

## Why markdown files?
It is much more readable than making blog posts in HTML code. 

## How rendering markdown files work
`node module: ngx-markdown`
